ML model made to predict weather a string of text (Amazon food reviews) has a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.


Some instructions to run the code:

Python Installation: Jupyter Notebooks are typically used with Python, so you should have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Jupyter Installation: You need to install Jupyter Notebook, which can be done using Python's package manager, pip. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
pip install notebook

Virtual Environment (Optional): It's a good practice to work in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts between different packages and versions. You can create a virtual environment using the venv or virtualenv tools.
Launch Jupyter Notebook: After installing Jupyter, you can start it by running the following command in your terminal:
jupyter notebook

This will open your web browser to the Jupyter Notebook interface, where you can create and run notebooks.

Notebook Kernel: Make sure you select the appropriate Python kernel when creating a new notebook. This kernel corresponds to the Python environment you want to use.

Additional Libraries: Depending on your specific project or analysis, you may need to install additional Python libraries. You can use pip to install these libraries.

Data and Files: Ensure that any data files or external dependencies required for your analysis are accessible from the Jupyter environment. You can upload files to your Jupyter environment from the web interface.

Save Your Work: Regularly save your work in the notebook to avoid losing progress. You can save your notebook as an IPython Notebook (.ipynb) file.

Markdown and Code Cells: Jupyter notebooks allow you to create cells for both code and Markdown text. Use Markdown cells for documentation, explanations, and comments.

Stopping and Closing: After you're done, remember to shut down the Jupyter Notebook server and close your web browser. You can do this by pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal where Jupyter is running and confirming the shutdown.

Version Control: If you're working on a collaborative project, consider using version control tools like Git to track changes in your notebooks.

Keep Jupyter Updated: Periodically update Jupyter Notebook and its dependencies to benefit from bug fixes and new features.

Make sure your Jupyter Notebook environment is properly configured with these considerations, and you'll be able to work smoothly and efficiently.
